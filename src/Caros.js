                                           <p>Cinema is a visual medium that helps in telling a story.
                                             Cinema is the most collaborative and the most expensive expression of art where millions of dollars are spent to show a story to the audience.
                                             Cinema could be anything ranging from a movie, television series, or even small commercial advertising the product.</p>
